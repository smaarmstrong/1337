// for studying this, do anki deck first.
// then add one code example with associated key words and definitions.

// anki card 1
// what is time complexity?
// time to run an algorithm as input size increases.

// anki card 2
// what is O(1) also known as?
// constant time.

// anki card 3
// why is it called constant time?
// constant time because it has the same running time regardless of input.

// anki card 4
// demonstrate constant time with a function
func checkFirstName(names: [String]) {
  print(names.first ?? "no first name")
}

// keep working on the above cards before doing anything else.
