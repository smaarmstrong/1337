// This validator is rudimentary but demonstrates key concepts:
// - It checks for a verification key hash (owner) in the datum and a message (msg) 
//   in the redeemer.
// - In the eUTxO model, the datum is set when locking funds in the contract,
//   and acts as a form of configuration.
// - The contract requires the owner's signature to unlock funds, similar to how
//   a typical non-script address works.
// - Additionally, the contract demands the exact message "Hello, World!" (UTF-8-encoded) 
//   to be passed in the redeemer when spending from the contract.
// 
// With these conditions, weâ€™ve set up a basic contract requiring a specific
// signature and message to validate transactions.
